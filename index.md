Deep learning has proved useful in solving many problems that can be phrased as function approximation.  

The approach is to state your problem such such that you have a parameterized, differentiable, scalar function $\mathcal L = f_\theta(x)$, where $\mathcal L$ becomes small when $f_\theta$ achieves some desired property.  Then using the fact that $\mathcal L$ is differentiable with respect to $\theta$, adjust $\theta$ to minimize $\mathcal L$.
