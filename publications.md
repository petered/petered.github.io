*Temporally Efficient Deep Learning with Spikes*
May 2017
Summary: We devise a scheme for implementing an approximation to backpropagation when input data is temporally redundant.  We show that this results in leaky integrate-and-fire neurons, and that the resulting learning rule is equivalent to a form of STDP.  We demonstrate that we can use this to train a deep network successfully.

*Sigma Delta Quantized Networks*
November 2016, accepted to ICLR 2017.  https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02024
Summary: We devise a scheme wheren neurons in a network communicate their quantized changes in activation, rather than their activation itself, allowing these networks to run more efficiently on temporally redundant data.

*Deep Spiking Networks*  
February 2016.  Available in pre-print at: [http://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.08323v1.pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.08323v1.pdf)
Summary: We implement backpropagation with event-based neurons.

*Real-Time Classification and Sensor Fusion with a Spiking Deep Belief Network*      
Frontiers in Neuroscience.  Vol 7, 2013.  [http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fnins.2013.00178](http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fnins.2013.00178)
Summary: We train a Deep Belief network to Associate digits with audio tones, and map the trained network onto an event-based network of Leaky Integrate and Fire neurons.  This was an early demonstration that deep networks can be implemented with spiking neurons.
