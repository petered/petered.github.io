After decades of being not very cool, Deep Learning has now become very, very cool.  It's become so cool that people sometimes forget there's another type of neural network that's being around for a while - the spiking neural network.  Spiking neural nets, like their more popular cousins (until recently), have a long and troubled history of having a lot of promise but not really being good at anything.  We am working on uniting spiking networks and deep learning.
